# GradeSpot
by Lemma Pumpers

## Inspiration
The idea for GradeSpot came when we realized how useful having a study group is for learning. It allows us to bounce ideas off of each other, ask questions, as well as help our peers. 

## What it does
GradeSpot is a one-stop-platform for organizing study groups, by scheduling a timeslot and space: whether online, in a virtual collaborative study space; or in person in one of the University's own classrooms through a booking system that uses QR code technology. 

## How we built it
We built GradeSpot using PHP for application logic control. HTML, CSS, jQuery, and JavaScript was used for user interface. Finally, MySQL was used for database management.

## What we learned
- The importance of teamwork and communication.
- Analyze and research before you consume any food.
- Next time, it is more optimal to get an adequate amount of rest before and during crunch time.
